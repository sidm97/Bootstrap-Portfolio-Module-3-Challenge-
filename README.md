# <My-Bootstrap-Portfolio-Page>

## Description

The purpose of creating this website was to build on my previous work with CSS and HTML in creating a profile website for myself, by using a framework library to replace unique code. As with my previous Portfolio pare, I have no work to speak of as yet, so the 5 images are merely placeholders for now. Hopefully prospective employers will be able to use this to guage my ability. In terms of my own learning, the project was very useful in cementing my understanding of Bootstrap's capabilities and its drawbacks. Unfortunately the work is incomplete in the latter regard as my coding of the button shadow and hyperlink hover effects were done with CSS rather than Bootstrap's inbuilt functions. I'm hoping that as I practice making other websites I'll be able to understand these better.

## Usage
This site has more functionality than my previous works. Not only do the links in the nav bar work as they should, Bootstrap's scripts mean it scrolls to each respective link which seems kinder on the eyes. There are multiple placeholder links in My Work that will be replaced by my live sites when they've been created. Finally, there is 1 external link to my Github page in the Contact Me section.

## Credits
Credit goes to the Skills Bootcamp that taught me how to use Bootstrap to create the website, with some CSS knowledge to help along the way. In addition, Zen Garden was a useful playground to learn how to change CSS elements to suit my needs.
